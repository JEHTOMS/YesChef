## Integration Complete âœ…

I've successfully integrated the `youtube-caption-extractor` library into our food-ai backend and cleaned up unused files:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added youtube-caption-extractor** as the primary transcript source in `server.mjs`
2. **Kept our direct scraper** as a fallback if the library fails
3. **Removed debug endpoints** (`/api/debug/search`, `/api/debug/transcript`) to clean unused APIs
4. **Deleted unused files**: `server-demo.mjs`, `server-simple.mjs`, `test-apis.mjs`, `test-server.mjs`, `transcript_fetcher.py`
5. **Updated package.json** with the new dependency

### How it works now:
- **Primary**: Uses `getVideoDetails()` from youtube-caption-extractor library
- **Fallback**: Falls back to our direct YouTube scraping if library fails
- **Same API**: No changes to the `/api/recipe` endpoint - works exactly as before
- **Better reliability**: The library may work from different IPs or handle rate limiting differently

### To test:
```bash
cd /Users/jehtoms/Downloads/mern-app/food-ai
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3001/YesChef or test the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/recipe -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"recipeName": "pasta carbonara"}'
```

The transcript extraction should now be more reliable, with the youtube-caption-extractor library handling the primary fetching and our custom scraper as backup.
